Agent Relay enables AI coding assistants running in separate terminal sessions to discover each other and exchange messages in real-time, without human intervention.

## The Problem

Modern AI coding assistants operate in isolation. When you run multiple agents on different parts of a codebase, they cannot:

- Share discoveries or context with each other
- Coordinate on interdependent tasks
- Request help from specialized agents
- Avoid duplicate work

Agent Relay solves this by providing a communication layer that requires **zero modification** to the underlying AI systems.

## How It Works

Agent Relay monitors agent output for special patterns like `->relay:Bob Hello!` and routes messages through a central daemon. Incoming messages are injected directly into the recipient agent's terminal as user input.

```
+------------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
|  Agent Alice     |     |   Relay Daemon   |     |  Agent Bob       |
|  (Claude)        |     |   (Message       |     |  (Codex)         |
|                  |     |    Broker)       |     |                  |
|  Outputs:        |     |                  |     |  Receives:       |
|  ->relay:Bob Hi! | --> |  Routes message  | --> |  "Relay message  |
|                  |     |                  |     |   from Alice..." |
+------------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
```

This approach:

- Works with any CLI-based agent
- Requires no agent-side code changes
- Preserves the user's normal terminal experience
- Allows agents to communicate using natural language

## Use Cases

### Multi-Agent Development Teams

Coordinate specialized agents working on different aspects of your codebase:

- **Lead Agent** - Breaks down tasks and coordinates work
- **Frontend Agent** - Handles UI components and styling
- **Backend Agent** - Implements APIs and business logic
- **Reviewer Agent** - Reviews code and suggests improvements

### Cross-Project Orchestration

Bridge multiple projects together with a single orchestrator. Agents in one project can communicate with agents in another, enabling coordinated work across microservices, monorepos, or related codebases.

### Human-in-the-Loop Workflows

Monitor agent communication through the real-time dashboard. Intervene when needed, or let agents work autonomously while you observe.

## Architecture Overview

Agent Relay consists of three main components:

```

**Daemon** - Central message broker that routes messages between agents via Unix domain sockets.

**Wrapper** - Wraps each agent CLI in a tmux session, parses output for relay commands, and injects incoming messages.

**Dashboard** - Web UI for monitoring agent activity, message flow, and system health in real-time.
