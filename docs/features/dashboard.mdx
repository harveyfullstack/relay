# Web Dashboard

Agent Relay includes a web dashboard for real-time monitoring of your agent network. View agent presence, message history, and coordinate your team from a central interface.

## Starting the Dashboard

The dashboard starts automatically with the daemon:

```bash
agent-relay up
```

By default, the dashboard runs on port **3888**:

```
Dashboard: http://localhost:3888
```

### Custom Port

Specify a different port with the `--port` flag:

```bash
agent-relay up --port 3889
```

Or set the environment variable:

```bash
export AGENT_RELAY_DASHBOARD_PORT=3889
agent-relay up
```

### Headless Mode

Run the daemon without the dashboard:

```bash
agent-relay up --no-dashboard
```

## Dashboard Features

### Agent Presence View

The main dashboard shows all connected agents in real-time:

- **Agent Name** - Identifier for each agent
- **Status** - Online/Offline indicator
- **CLI** - The AI provider (claude, codex, gemini)
- **Last Seen** - Timestamp of last activity
- **Team** - Team assignment (if configured)

### Real-time Updates

The dashboard uses WebSocket connections to provide instant updates:

- New agents appear immediately when they connect
- Status changes reflect within seconds
- Message activity updates live

### Message History

View the conversation log between agents:

- Filter by agent name or channel
- Search message content
- View full message details
- Track message delivery status

### Agent Logs

Monitor individual agent output in real-time:

1. Click on an agent in the presence view
2. Select "View Logs" to open the log panel
3. Logs stream live as the agent works

Use the CLI to view logs without the dashboard:

```bash
agent-relay agents:logs <agent-name>
```

## Coordinator Panel

The coordinator panel provides orchestration controls:

### Spawning Agents

Spawn new worker agents directly from the dashboard:

1. Click "Spawn Agent" in the coordinator panel
2. Enter agent name and CLI tool
3. Provide the initial task description
4. Click "Spawn"

### Releasing Agents

Stop agents that have completed their work:

1. Select the agent in the presence view
2. Click "Release" to gracefully stop the agent
3. Confirm the release action

### Team Management

If you have a `teams.json` configuration, the dashboard shows:

- Team hierarchy view
- Role assignments
- Auto-spawn status

## Dashboard API

The dashboard exposes a REST API for programmatic access:

### Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:3888/api/health
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy"
}
```

### List Agents

```bash
curl http://localhost:3888/api/agents
```

Response:
```json
{
  "agents": [
    {
      "name": "Lead",
      "cli": "claude",
      "status": "ONLINE",
      "lastSeen": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Send Message

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3888/api/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "to": "Worker1",
    "message": "Please review the PR",
    "from": "Lead"
  }'
```

### Spawn Agent

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3888/api/spawn \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Reviewer",
    "cli": "claude",
    "task": "Review all pending pull requests"
  }'
```

### Release Agent

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3888/api/release \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Reviewer"
  }'
```

## Bridge Dashboard

When running in bridge mode, the dashboard shows cross-project status:

```bash
agent-relay bridge ~/project-a ~/project-b
```

The bridge dashboard displays:

- Connected projects and their status
- Lead agents in each project
- Cross-project message flow
- Reconnection status

See [Multi-Project Bridging](/features/bridging) for details.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `AGENT_RELAY_DASHBOARD_PORT` | Dashboard port | `3888` |
| `AGENT_RELAY_DATA_DIR` | Data directory | `~/.local/share/agent-relay` |

### Data Storage

Dashboard data is stored in the project data directory:

```
.relay/
  agents.json           # Agent registry
  connected-agents.json # Live connections
  messages.db           # SQLite message store
  worker-logs/          # Agent log files
```

## Supervisor Mode

Run the daemon with automatic restart on crash:

```bash
agent-relay up --watch
```

Options:

- `--max-restarts <n>` - Maximum restarts in 60 seconds (default: 5)

The supervisor will restart the daemon automatically if it crashes, up to the maximum restart limit within the time window.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Dashboard not loading">
    1. Check if the daemon is running: `agent-relay status`
    2. Verify the port is not in use: `lsof -i :3888`
    3. Try a different port: `agent-relay up --port 3890`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agents not appearing">
    1. Agents must send a HELLO message to register
    2. Check agent logs for connection errors
    3. Verify the socket path matches between daemon and agents
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="WebSocket disconnections">
    1. Check for network issues or firewalls
    2. The dashboard auto-reconnects on disconnection
    3. Refresh the page if state becomes stale
  </Accordion>
