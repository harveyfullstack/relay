# Session Continuity

Agent Relay's continuity system helps agents maintain context across sessions, enabling seamless handoffs and work resumption.

## Overview

The continuity system consists of two components:

| Component | Purpose | Persistence |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Ledger** | Current session state (task, progress, decisions) | Ephemeral (overwritten each session) |
| **Handoff** | Cross-session transfer document | Permanent (searchable history) |

```

## Saving State

<Steps>
  <Step title="Write continuity file">
    Save your current state when:
    - Before long-running operations (builds, tests)
    - When switching task areas
    - Every 15-20 minutes of active work
    - Before ending a session

    ```bash
    cat > /tmp/relay-outbox/$AGENT_RELAY_NAME/continuity << 'EOF'
    KIND: continuity
    ACTION: save

    Current task: Implementing user authentication
    Completed:
    - User model created
    - JWT utility functions
    - Password hashing with bcrypt

    In progress:
    - Login endpoint (70% complete)

    Key decisions:
    - Using refresh tokens for session management
    - Bcrypt with cost factor 12
    - JWT expires in 15 minutes

    Files:
    - src/auth/user.ts
    - src/auth/jwt.ts
    - src/api/routes/login.ts (in progress)
    EOF
    ```

    Then output: `->relay-file:continuity`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify save">
    The system acknowledges successful saves. You can check status:

    ```bash
    agent-relay continuity status
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Loading Previous Context

### Automatic loading

Context loads automatically when an agent starts. The agent sees:

```markdown
## Previous Session Context

**Current Task:** Implementing user authentication

**Completed:**
- User model created
- JWT utility functions
- Password hashing with bcrypt

**In Progress:**
- Login endpoint (70% complete)

**Key Decisions:**
- Using refresh tokens for session management
- Bcrypt with cost factor 12
- JWT expires in 15 minutes

**Files:**
- src/auth/user.ts
- src/auth/jwt.ts
- src/api/routes/login.ts (in progress)
```

### Manual loading

Request context manually during a session:

```bash
cat > /tmp/relay-outbox/$AGENT_RELAY_NAME/load << 'EOF'
KIND: continuity
ACTION: load
EOF
```

Then: `->relay-file:load`

## Creating Handoffs

Handoffs are permanent records created when work transitions between sessions or agents.

### When to create handoffs

- Completing a major task or milestone
- Handing off to another agent
- Before a planned break
- When context limits are approaching

### Handoff structure

```bash
cat > /tmp/relay-outbox/$AGENT_RELAY_NAME/handoff << 'EOF'
KIND: continuity
ACTION: handoff

Summary: User authentication system implemented

Completed work:
- User model with email/password
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- Login, logout, and register endpoints
- Password reset flow with email verification
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints

Next steps:
- Add OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
- Implement session management UI
- Add 2FA support

Key decisions:
- Refresh tokens stored in httpOnly cookies (security)
- 15-minute JWT expiry with 7-day refresh (balance)
- Bcrypt cost factor 12 (security vs performance)

Files to know:
- src/auth/ - Core authentication logic
- src/api/routes/auth.ts - Endpoints
- src/middleware/auth.ts - JWT verification
- tests/auth/ - Test suite

Learnings:
- JWT refresh race condition when multiple tabs open
- Bcrypt is CPU-intensive, consider worker threads for high load
EOF
```

Then: `->relay-file:handoff`

### Handoff triggers

Handoffs are created automatically on:

| Trigger | When |
|---------|------|
| `trajectory_complete` | When `trail complete` is called |
| `context_limit` | When context is approaching token limit |
| `session_end` | Normal session termination |
| `crash` | Unexpected agent termination |
| `manual` | Explicit handoff request |

## Resume Tokens

When an agent crashes or is interrupted, it receives a resume token for recovery.

### Using resume tokens

```bash
# Start agent with resume token
agent-relay -n MyAgent claude --resume <agent-id>
```

The agent receives its previous context and can continue work.

### Finding resume tokens

```bash
# List recent sessions with resume capability
agent-relay continuity list

# Output:
# AGENT         LAST ACTIVE    RESUME TOKEN
# Lead          2 hours ago    sess_abc123
# Backend       1 day ago      sess_def456
```

## Marking Uncertainties

Flag items that need future verification:

```bash
cat > /tmp/relay-outbox/$AGENT_RELAY_NAME/uncertain << 'EOF'
KIND: continuity
ACTION: uncertain

API rate limit handling might not cover all edge cases.
Need to verify behavior under sustained load.
EOF
```

Then: `->relay-file:uncertain`

Uncertain items are:
- Prefixed with `UNCONFIRMED:` in context
- Highlighted for future agents
- Available for searching

## Searching Past Work

Find relevant context from past sessions:

```bash
cat > /tmp/relay-outbox/$AGENT_RELAY_NAME/search << 'EOF'
KIND: continuity
ACTION: search

Query: WebSocket authentication
EOF
```

Then: `->relay-file:search`

Response:

```markdown
## Search Results: "WebSocket authentication"

### Handoff: Real-time notifications (2 days ago)
Agent: FeatureWorker
Summary: WebSocket server with JWT authentication

Key decisions:
- Token passed via query param on connect
- Validate on connection, reject if invalid
- No re-auth during connection (close + reconnect)

Files: src/ws/auth.ts, src/ws/server.ts

### Handoff: API security review (1 week ago)
Agent: Security
Summary: Authentication mechanisms audit

Relevant: WebSocket auth should validate same as REST
```

</CardGroup>

### Save frequency guidelines

| Activity | Save Frequency |
|----------|----------------|
| Active coding | Every 15-20 minutes |
| Before builds/tests | Always |
| Task switching | Always |
| End of work session | Always |
| After major decision | Immediately |

### Handoff quality checklist

A good handoff should enable another agent (or yourself later) to:

- [ ] Understand what was accomplished
- [ ] Know where to find relevant code
- [ ] Understand key decisions and why
- [ ] Know what to do next
- [ ] Avoid repeating mistakes or research

## Integration with Trail

Continuity works with the trajectory system (trail) for richer history:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with trail">
    ```bash
    trail start "Implement user authentication"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Record decisions during work">
    ```bash
    trail decision "Using JWT with refresh tokens" \
      --reasoning "Stateless auth, better scaling"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete with summary">
    ```bash
    trail complete \
      --summary "Auth system implemented with JWT" \
      --confidence 0.85
    ```

    This automatically creates a handoff with trajectory context.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## CLI Commands

```bash
# Check continuity status for current agent
agent-relay continuity status

# List all agents with continuity data
agent-relay continuity list

# View ledger for specific agent
agent-relay continuity show <agent-name>

# Search handoffs
agent-relay continuity search "authentication"

# Clean up old handoffs (keeps last 30 days)
agent-relay continuity cleanup --days 30
```

## Troubleshooting

### Context not loading on startup

```bash
# Check if continuity data exists
agent-relay continuity show <agent-name>

# Manually trigger load
cat > /tmp/relay-outbox/$AGENT_RELAY_NAME/load << 'EOF'
KIND: continuity
ACTION: load
EOF
```

### Handoff not created on crash

Check the crash logs:

```bash
agent-relay agents:logs <agent-name> --since crash
```

Auto-save might have failed if:
- Agent exited too quickly
- Disk was full
- Permissions issue on continuity directory

### Large context causing issues

If context is too large:
- Use more frequent handoffs to summarize
- Focus ledger on current task only
- Search for specific context instead of loading all
