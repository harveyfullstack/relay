# Editor Integration with ACP

Agent Relay can be integrated with code editors like [Zed](https://zed.dev), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [Neovim](https://neovim.io), and other editors that support the [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com).

## What is ACP?

The **Agent Client Protocol** is an open standard (created by Zed Industries) that enables AI agents to integrate with code editors. Think of it as LSP (Language Server Protocol), but for AI coding agents.

ACP provides:
- Standardized communication between editors and AI agents
- Session management for conversations
- Tool permissions and file operations
- Streaming responses

## Architecture

The ACP bridge connects your editor to all your relay agents:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ACP (stdio)    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Zed Editor    │ ◄────────────────► │  relay-acp      │
│   (or other)    │   JSON-RPC 2.0     │  (bridge)       │
└─────────────────┘                    └────────┬────────┘
                                                │
                                       Relay Protocol
                                                │
                                       ┌────────▼────────┐
                                       │  Relay Daemon   │
                                       └────────┬────────┘
                                                │
                        ┌───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┐
                        │                       │                       │
                   Agent 1                 Agent 2                 Agent N
                   (Claude)                (Codex)                 (any CLI)
```

When you send a prompt from your editor:

1. The editor sends the prompt via ACP to the bridge
2. The bridge broadcasts to all connected relay agents
3. Agents respond through the relay daemon
4. The bridge streams responses back to the editor

## Quick Start (Zed)

### 1. Start the Daemon and Configure Zed

```bash
agent-relay up --zed
```

This starts the relay daemon and auto-configures Zed's `~/.config/zed/settings.json` with the correct paths for your workspace.

### 2. Spawn Some Agents

Create agents that will respond to editor prompts:

```bash
# Spawn a code review agent
agent-relay spawn Reviewer claude "Review code changes and suggest improvements"

# Spawn an architect agent
agent-relay spawn Architect claude "Help with system design and architecture decisions"
```

### 3. Start Chatting

Open Zed's Agent Panel with `Cmd+?` (macOS) or `Ctrl+?` (Windows/Linux), select **"Agent Relay"**, and start typing. You can:
- **Broadcast to all agents**: Just type your message
- **Target specific agents**: Use `@AgentName` (e.g., `@Reviewer check this code`)

## Run Relay Commands from Zed

From the Zed Agent Panel you can issue relay CLI-style commands directly (the bridge intercepts them, no shell required):

- `agent-relay spawn Reviewer claude "Review the current changes"`
- `agent-relay release Reviewer`
- `agent-relay agents` (lists connected agents)

Currently supported commands: spawn/create-agent, release, agents/who. All other messages are still broadcast to your connected agents. A quick help block is shown when a new conversation starts; type `agent-relay help` to see it again.

## Troubleshooting

### Bridge not connecting to daemon

Ensure the relay daemon is running:

```bash
agent-relay status
```

If not running, start it:

```bash
agent-relay up
```

### No responses from agents

Check if any agents are connected:

```bash
agent-relay who
```

If no agents are listed, spawn some:

```bash
agent-relay spawn Worker claude "Help with coding tasks"
```

## Other Editors (Advanced)

For editors other than Zed, you'll need to install the ACP bridge package and configure your editor manually.

### Programmatic Usage

You can use the bridge programmatically in your own tools:

```typescript
import { RelayACPAgent } from '@agent-relay/acp-bridge';

const agent = new RelayACPAgent({
  agentName: 'my-custom-bridge',
  socketPath: '/tmp/relay-daemon.sock',
  debug: true,
  capabilities: {
    supportsSessionLoading: false,
  },
});

await agent.start();
```

#### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `agentName` | string | `'relay-acp'` | Name used when connecting to relay daemon |
| `socketPath` | string | auto | Path to relay daemon socket |
| `debug` | boolean | `false` | Enable debug logging |
| `capabilities` | object | - | ACP capabilities to advertise |

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @agent-relay/acp-bridge
```

Or build from source:

```bash
cd packages/acp-bridge
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

### Neovim

Requires an ACP-compatible Neovim plugin (e.g., [acp.nvim](https://github.com/acp-nvim/acp.nvim)):

```lua
require('acp').setup({
  agents = {
    {
      name = "Agent Relay",
      command = "relay-acp",
      args = {
        "--name", "nvim-bridge",
        "--socket", "/path/to/your/project/.agent-relay/relay.sock"
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### VS Code

The [vscode-acp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=omercnet.vscode-acp) extension brings ACP support to VS Code. Install it from the marketplace:

1. Open VS Code Extensions (`Cmd+Shift+X` / `Ctrl+Shift+X`)
2. Search for "vscode-acp"
3. Click Install

**Current limitation**: The extension auto-detects agents from a built-in list (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Gemini, etc.) and doesn't yet support custom agents like Agent Relay. You can use any of the supported agents, which will work alongside your relay agents if they're running.

We're working with the vscode-acp maintainer to add custom agent support. Track progress at [omercnet/vscode-acp](https://github.com/omercnet/vscode-acp).

### Other ACP-Compatible Editors

For any editor that supports the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com), configure it to run:

```bash
relay-acp --name my-editor-bridge --socket /path/to/.agent-relay/relay.sock
```

The bridge communicates via stdio using newline-delimited JSON (ACP protocol).

### Manual Zed Configuration

If you prefer not to use `--zed`, add this to `~/.config/zed/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Agent Relay": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "relay-acp",
      "args": [
        "--name", "zed-bridge",
        "--socket", "/path/to/your/project/.agent-relay/relay.sock",
        "--debug"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```
