---

This guide will have you running your first multi-agent network in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** 18 or higher
- **tmux** installed on your system
- At least one AI CLI installed (Claude, Codex, Cursor, or Gemini)

## Installation

Install Agent Relay globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g agent-relay
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
agent-relay --version
```

Check that agents know how to use the agent-relay protocol
```bash
npx prpm install @agent-relay/agent-relay-snippet

# If Claude
npx prpm install @agent-relay/agent-relay-snippet --location CLAUDE.md
```

## Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the Daemon">
    The daemon is the central message broker. Start it first:

    ```bash
    agent-relay up --dashboard
    ```

    You should see:
    ```
    Daemon started on /tmp/agent-relay.sock
    Dashboard available at http://localhost:3888
    ```

    <Tip>
      The daemon runs in the background. You can check its status anytime with `agent-relay status`.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Your First Agent">
    Open a new terminal and create an agent named "Alice":

    ```bash
    agent-relay create-agent -n Alice claude
    ```

    This wraps the Claude CLI in a tmux session with relay messaging enabled. The agent is now connected to the relay network.

    <Note>
      Replace `claude` with `codex` or `gemini` if you prefer a different AI provider.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Second Agent">
    Open another terminal and create a second agent named "Bob":

    ```bash
    agent-relay create-agent -n Bob claude
    ```

    You now have two agents connected to the same relay network.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Your First Message">
    In Alice's terminal, ask the agent to send a message to Bob:

    ```
    Send a message to Bob saying hello
    ```

    Alice will output something like:
    ```
    ->relay:Bob Hello! Nice to meet you.
    ```

    The relay system automatically detects this pattern, extracts the message, and delivers it to Bob.
  </Step>

  <Step title="View the Dashboard">
    Open your browser to [http://localhost:3888](http://localhost:3888) to see the real-time dashboard.

    The dashboard shows:
    - Connected agents (Alice and Bob)
    - Message flow between agents
    - System health and metrics
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Message Formats

Agents communicate by outputting special patterns that the relay system detects:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Direct Message
  ->relay:Bob Can you review my code changes?
  ```

  ```bash Broadcast to All
  ->relay:* I've finished the auth module
  ```

  ```bash With Thread Context
  ->relay:Alice [thread:code-review] LGTM, merging now
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Receiving Messages

When Bob receives a message from Alice, it appears in their terminal as:

```
Relay message from Alice [abc12345]: Hello! Nice to meet you.
```

The message ID (`abc12345`) can be used to read the full content if the message was truncated:

```bash
agent-relay read abc12345
```

## Common Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `agent-relay up` | Start the daemon and dashboard |
| `agent-relay down` | Stop the daemon |
| `agent-relay status` | Check daemon and agent status |
| `agent-relay create-agent -n Name <cli>` | Create a new agent |
| `agent-relay agents` | List connected agents |
| `agent-relay read <id>` | Read full message content |

## Quick Test Script

Want to see it all work together? Run this quick test:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the daemon
agent-relay up

# Terminal 2: Start Alice
agent-relay create-agent -n Alice claude

# Terminal 3: Start Bob
agent-relay create-agent -n Bob claude

# In Alice's terminal, type:
# "Send a greeting to Bob"

# Watch the message appear in Bob's terminal!
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Daemon not running">
    If you see "Daemon not running" errors:

    ```bash
    # Check status
    agent-relay status

    # Start the daemon
    agent-relay up
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="tmux not found">
    Install tmux for your platform:

    ```bash
    # macOS
    brew install tmux

    # Linux
    sudo apt-get install tmux
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Messages not delivering">
    1. Verify both agents are connected: `agent-relay agents`
    2. Check agent names match exactly (case-insensitive)
    3. Ensure the message format is correct: `->relay:Name message`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission denied on socket">
    Remove stale socket file and restart:

    ```bash
    rm /tmp/agent-relay.sock
    agent-relay down
    agent-relay up
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
