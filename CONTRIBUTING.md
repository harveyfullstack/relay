2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - Clear, descriptive title
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Your environment (OS, Node version)
   - Relevant logs or error messages

### Suggesting Features

1. Check existing issues and discussions first
2. Open a new issue with the "feature request" label
3. Describe the use case and proposed solution

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes
4. Ensure tests pass: `npm test`
5. Ensure linting passes: `npm run lint`
6. Commit with a descriptive message
7. Push to your fork
8. Open a Pull Request

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single change
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Follow existing code style
- Write clear commit messages

## Code Style

- TypeScript with strict mode
- Use ESLint configuration provided
- Prefer async/await over callbacks
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Example

```typescript
/**
 * Send a message to another agent.
 * @param recipient - Target agent name or '*' for broadcast
 * @param body - Message content
 * @param type - Message type (default: 'message')
 * @returns true if message was sent successfully
 */
sendMessage(recipient: string, body: string, type?: MessageType): boolean {
  // Implementation
}
```

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test file
npm test -- src/wrapper/parser.test.ts
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests next to source files (`.test.ts`) or in `tests/`
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Mock external dependencies

## Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add JSDoc comments for new public APIs
- Update examples if adding new features
- Keep PROTOCOL.md updated for protocol changes

## Release Process

1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create a GitHub release
4. npm publish is automated via GitHub Actions

## Getting Help

- Open an issue for bugs or feature requests
- Check existing issues and documentation first
