## Summary

Added two sections to relay-snippets/agent-relay-snippet.md: (1) Here-Document Tips subsection with EOF quoting rules and echo fallback, (2) Concrete ACK/DONE example messages in Protocol section. Changes based on Gemini's documentation feedback.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Added here-document tips and protocol examples based on Gemini feedback
- **Chose:** Added here-document tips and protocol examples based on Gemini feedback
- **Reasoning:** Gemini struggled with heredoc syntax and ACK/DONE format. Added concise tips (EOF quoting, whitespace rules, echo fallback) and concrete protocol examples. Skipped agent naming expansion since existing examples already cover it well.
