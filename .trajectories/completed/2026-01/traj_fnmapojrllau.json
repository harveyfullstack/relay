            "reasoning": "Two parallel channel implementations exist: 1) Daemon-based channels with protocol support (CHANNEL_JOIN, CHANNEL_MESSAGE) already built and tested in router.ts 2) Cloud-based channels with separate PostgreSQL tables added later without integration. The cloud system creates unnecessary complexity - agents can't participate without polling, and the daemon already supports channel messaging natively. Unifying on daemon channels simplifies architecture and enables real-time agent participation in channels."
